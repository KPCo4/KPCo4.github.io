            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Kelvin Control Enhancements (KCE) provides Operational Technology (OT) services to a local nuclear power station, 
                alongside corporate IT, SCADA remote operations, and a wellbeing platform (MindfulCheck).
                A combination of weak governance, poor segmentation, inadequate logging, and unmanaged third-party access
                has contributed to data leaks, operational risk, and potential exposure of critical infrastructure.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>OT firmware updates are downloaded directly from the Internet without verification.</li>
                <li>Temporary staff, subcontractors, and external suppliers retain privileged access.</li>
                <li>OT and IT network boundaries are weak, with a flat core IT network.</li>
                <li>No formal security governance or oversight exists at a leadership level.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Key Findings -->
            <section id="key-findings">
                <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <p>The risk assessment of KCE's OT and IT networks revealed several critical observations that have implications for operational security, governance, and resilience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uncontrolled access:</strong> Field engineers, temporary staff, and external suppliers retain high levels of access to both OT and IT networks, increasing the risk of accidental or malicious activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate logging and monitoring:</strong> The current systems fail to capture detailed logs of user activity or anomalies, reducing the ability to detect, investigate, and respond to incidents.</li>
                    <li><strong>OT network vulnerabilities:</strong> Direct internet access and unverified firmware updates pose a significant risk to critical ICS systems, creating potential pathways for compromise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flat IT network architecture:</strong> Lack of segmentation allows lateral movement across services and increases exposure of high-value systems such as domain controllers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak governance and Culture:</strong> Security policies are underdeveloped, board-level oversight is limited, and staff awareness of security risks is inconsistent, making enforcement and accountability difficult.</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical mitigation opportunities:</strong> Implementing access controls, zero-trust principles, verified firmware workflows, segmentation, logging, and importantly good policy would address many of the identified risks.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Lessons Learned-->
            <section id="lessons-learned">
                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access must be intentionally designed, not inherited:</strong> Long-standing "default trust" in both IT and OT environments has introduced unnecessary exposure. Access control models must be actively maintained, reviewed, and justified.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visibility is essential for resilience:</strong> Without comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting, even well-designed controls cannot prevent or contain threats effectively. Detection capabilities must evolve alongside prevention measures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security relies on validated sources:</strong> The lack of implementation for trusted firmware update pathways demonstrates how easily supply-chain weaknesses can undermine system security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Segmentation is fundamental, not optional:</strong> Flat networks-especially in critical environments enable rapid lateral movement and undermine containment strategies. Segmentation should be treated as a baseline requirement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Governance shapes technical outcomes:</strong> Cultural and procedural gaps (e.g. unclear rules, inconsistent enforcement, limited board oversight) significantly influence the organisation's risk posture. Technical fixes alone cannot compensate for weak governance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proper security requires understanding business objectives:</strong> The incomplete information in the scenario highlighted the importance of grounding security decisions in the organisation's business plan ensuring that controls support, rather than obstruct, operational needs.</li>
                </ul>
